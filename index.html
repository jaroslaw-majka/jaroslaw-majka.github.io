          I'm a graduate of Economics, currently working as a Software Engineer. 
          I love working on complex problems and solving them. 
          Programming has been a huge part of my life. Even though for some time I've been occupied with Economics 
          I have never stopped programming, and during that time I've created a few Android mobile apps. 
          If you are interested in the projects I worked on, here you can find a summary of those.</p>
