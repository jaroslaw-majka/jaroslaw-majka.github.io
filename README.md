# About me

Hi,
<p>My name is Jarek and I created this repository to keep track of the projects I had a great pleasure to participate in.
<p>I love programing. Analyzing and solving complex problems is really fun to me.

# This repository

This repository is a simple one-pager created with bootstrap.
