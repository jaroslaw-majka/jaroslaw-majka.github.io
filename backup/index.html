          I'm a graduate of Economics, currently working as a Software Engineer. 
          I love working on complex problems and solving them. 
          Programming has been a huge part of my life. Even though for some time I've been occupied with Economics 
          I have never stopped programming, and during that time I've created a few Android mobile apps.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I like to think of myself as an engaged, hard working person, who loves to create high quality code and 
          search for solutions that will make not only the code, or app work better, but also will increare the user experience.
          I am not affraid to try out new technologies, I am very agile and very happy to learn.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">If you are interested in the projects I worked on, here you can find a summary of those.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-2">
          Currently I am working in a Cloud Infrastructure team, where we build from scratch infrastructure for multi-tenant services in AWS. 
          This project requires all our team members to develop high quality, scalable, secure, automated infrastructure 
          that will serve the multi-tenancy purposes. I've implemented multiple key features, worked on networking from API Gateway to the Kuberentes Cluster, 
          and on routing within the cluster.
          On top of that I have also created a pipeline (using AWS Code Build and AWS Code Pipeline), to automate deployment of our infrastructure whenever a merge, 
          to certain branches is made.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-2">
          While working on this project I have been honoured with receiving "Team Player" award for my continuous commitment to not only the product, but also team development.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-2">
          Some of the AWS services that I've worked on are: API Gateway, EKS, ALB, NLB, VPC, Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda, Code Build, Code Pipeline, CloudFormation

          During my permanence in MicroStrategy for a short period of time (approx 4-5 months) I've worked in a

          An application I created mostly for myself to keep track of the books I've read, I want to read, books I've borrowed to, and from someone. 
          This application was in fact deployed on Google Play, at it's peak it had approx 300 users, without any advertising. 
          It's been a great journey creating this app, even though it's now unavailable for download.
